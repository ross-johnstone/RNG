			RNG is a collaborative video game database website that allows anyone to search and sort Relatively New Games (released in the past 10 years) and 
			view what users and verified critics have rated these games. If you <a href="{% url 'registration_register' %}">sign up</a> and <a href="{% url 'auth_login' %}">sign 
			in</a> you can join in on the action and Rate New Games too! Be sure to use our categories function to help find similar games and be on the 
			lookout for a <i class="criticEmail">critic</i> tag on a user as that means that the user is one of our verified critics. And if you're feeling lucky punk, you can use our Random New Game 
			function on the home page to view a random game's page! â€‹

			<p>

			We hope RNG will help you to make informed choices on what games to buy, provide a discussion hub for games between you and other users and above all
			else be a fun and optimisied experience.

			<p>

			If you are a game critic please email <b class="criticEmail">RateNewGamesAdmin@gmail.com</b> and we will verify you.
